# The iOS version of Quackie Chattie
I made the android version for a friend and realized that I can't even use it because I have an iPhone. So I learned Xcode and swift within a few days and finally made a semi-working version of the android release. Unfortunately, I can't release this in the store (not that it's good enough to download). However I think(?) I can just add
iOS's version of an android APK here?

# The design
Very similar, except it still needs to be worked on. Contrary to the current trend, I actually find Android Studio much more easier to handle than Xcode.

# Tools/Libraries used
- Google Sign-In
- Socket.IO (Swift Client Version)
- Firebase

# To-Do
1. Continue working on views
2. Fix issues with keyboard I/O (message doesn't send nor does the keyboard retract upon clicking the Return key)
3. Continue figuring out if I should really pay to be an Apple developer or install this app everyweek. (I am a broke college student)
4. Clean-up code (I brute forced learning Swift and SwiftUI so i am so sorry for the mess. I also learned app development like two weeks ago)
